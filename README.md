# Data Science Lab Machine Learning with scikit-learn course

To run the course content, clone or download (green "Code" button) this repository. You will need Jupyter, scikit-learn and seaborn to run the content. One way of installing these packages is to use conda with the [```environment.yml```](environment.yml) file provided in this repository. For this, open a terminal (regular terminal on OSX, Miniconda/Miniforge Prompt on Windows), move to the repository and run:
    
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dslsklearn
jupyter lab
```

This will open Jupyter Lab in your browser. You can then navigate to the notebooks and run them.

If you notice any error or have questions, please open an issue.
